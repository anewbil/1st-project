# 1st-project
As a health-conscious and nature-loving individual, I want to effortlessly access real-time air quality data and information about nearby parks, so I can make informed decisions about when and where to engage in outdoor activities.

Acceptance Criteria:

API Integration:
The application must integrate with a minimum of two APIs, ensuring functionality and data accuracy.
Each API must serve a distinct purpose relevant to the application's objectives.

Client-Side Storage Implementation:
Persistent data storage must be implemented on the client-side to ensure user data integrity and seamless interaction.
The application should utilize client-side storage mechanisms such as local storage or IndexedDB to store user preferences, search history, or other relevant data.

Air Quality and Parks Display:
Upon searching for a specific area, the application must display:
Real-time air quality information for the searched area, sourced from an air quality API.
Nearby parks within the searched area, retrieved from an appropriate parks API.
The displayed air quality information should include relevant parameters such as AQI (Air Quality Index), pollutant levels, and health advisories if available.
Park listings should include essential details like name, location, amenities, and any special features.

User Interaction and Interface:
The user interface should provide intuitive search functionality, enabling users to input their desired location easily.
The application should display the retrieved air quality and park data in a clear and visually appealing manner.
User interactions such as searching, viewing park details, and refreshing air quality information should be smooth and responsive.
Accessibility features should be implemented to ensure usability for users with diverse needs.

Error Handling and Edge Cases:
The application should handle potential errors gracefully, providing informative messages to users in case of API failures or network issues.
Edge cases such as invalid user inputs or unavailable data from APIs should be appropriately managed to prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.

Performance and Optimization:
The application should be optimized for performance, ensuring fast loading times and minimal resource consumption.
Data fetching from APIs should be efficiently managed to avoid excessive network requests and improve overall responsiveness.

Documentation:
Clear and concise documentation must be provided, detailing the application's functionality, usage instructions, and API integration guidelines.
API documentation, including endpoints, parameters, and authentication requirements, should be included for reference.
Code documentation and inline comments should facilitate understanding and maintenance by other developers.
